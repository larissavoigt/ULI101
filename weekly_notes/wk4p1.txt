Data Representation
------------------

The number systems that we deal with in computers are:

Decimal: comes from 'deca', which means 10 unique symbols namely: 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 
    so decimal is base 10 which is what we are used to.

Binary: comes from 'bi', which is 2 so there are two symbols.
    0 1

Octal: comes from 'octa', which is 8 so there are eight unique symbols
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Hexadecimal: comes from 'hexa', which is 16 so there are 16 unique symbols
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

HOWTO convert from
------------------

* Decimal to Binary

    example: What is decimal number 49 in binary
    Answer:
                                    1  1 0 0 0 1
     powers of 2^n where n>=0:  64 32 16 8 4 2 1
        so:
            49 is between 64 and 32 that is why 1 is put above 32
            next 49-32= 17 which is between 32 and 16 so 1 is above 16
            next 17-16= 1  so 1 is above 1
            finally put zeros everywhere else you now have
                
                49 => 1 1 0 0 0 1 

    So
     Decimal => Binary
          49 => 110001

* Binary to Decimal

    example: What is binary number 111001 in decimal
    Answer:

            111001 =  1  1 1 0 0 1
                     32 16 8 4 2 1 

                     32+16+8+1 = 57

    So
      Binary  => Decimal
       111001 => 57

* Binary to Octal 
    
    example: What is 111001 (57 decimal) in octal
    Answer:

            Binary number grouped by 3 111001 =  111 001
            Look at the above table           =   7   1

    So 
        Binary => Octal
        111001 => 71


* Octal to Binary
    
    example: What is 37 octal in binary
    Answer:
        
            Octal number:  37  =     3  7
            Look at above table=    011 111

    So 
        Octal => Binary 
           37 => 011 111 or 11111

    

* Hexadecimal to Octal

    example: What is 1F hexadecimal in octal
    Answer:

        first convert hex to binary so looking at the above table

                1F = 0001 1111

        next group by 3
            
                1F =  0001 1111 = 00 011 111

        look at the above table to convert to octal

                00 011 111 = 37

    So
        Hexadecimal => Octal
                1F  => 37

* Octal to Hexadecimal

    example:    What is 43 octal in hexadecimal
    Answer:
            
        first convert octal to binary so looking at the above table

                43 = 100 110

        next group by 4 
            
                43 = 100 110 = 10  0110

        look at the above table to convert to hex
        
                10 0110 = 2 3

        So
            Octal => Hexadecimal
               43 => 23 


Use 
    
    chmod (octal number) (file/dir)     # set permissions using octal


Symbolic and Octal notations for chmod
---------------------------------------

- octal notation is a series of 3 octal numbers representing user,
  group and others. For example:

    755 = read,write,execute to user; read,execute to group and others
    640 = read,write to user; read to group, none to others

- symbolic notation is

    u,g,o,a for user, group, others and all
    + to add perms (r,w,x)
    - to remove perms (r,w,x)
    = to set perms (r,w,x)

    for example:

    chmod u+rwx,g-w,o= means user gets all, remove write from group,
    and set nothing to others.

- umask is used to affect permissions of new files and directories,
  try doing this:

    $ umask
    (see the value you get)

    now change umask to deny all permissions to group and others, then
    create a new file and directory to verify that the newly created
    files and directories denied permissions to group and others.
