Question
--------
Create a link to the backup directory in documents and call the link backup.


Answer:

You are asked to do the following
    - (the link target is to directory) backup
    - (link location is in directory)   documents
    - (link name is )                   backup
    - (your PWD is)                     school

links/uli101/work/midterm_green/
├── backup
│   └── documents.tar.gz
├── documents                   link name 'backup' points to location ../backup
│   ├── private
│   │   └── finances.csv
│   ├── quote.txt
│   ├── school                  <= You are here (.. is documents, so ../backup)
│   │   └── uli101
│   └── summary.odp
└── tmp
    └── xyz.tmp

based on PWD of school, your answer on the command line is
ln -s   ../backup ../backup
 (soft) (target)  (location relative to pwd with link name)  


Hard links
----------

Hard links create 'live' backups to files
- if content of original file changes then backup file changes too
- ls -l shows the number of hard links to a file, 
- increases by one each time a hard link is added with ln
- decreases by one each time a hard link file is removed by rm
- only root can create hard links to directories


example
$ touch hello                   # create empty file hello
$ echo "Hello World" >> hello   # add some content to it
$ ln hello hello.backup         # create hard link called hello.backup
$ ls -l                         # note that link number shows 2 (up by 1)
$ rm hello                      # remove original file
$ cat hello.backup              # hard link has content from original file
