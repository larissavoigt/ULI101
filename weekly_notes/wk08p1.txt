Hard links
----------
Hard links are physical copies of files. Let's say you create a new
file named file, so 

    touch file

Now

    ls -l file

will show the long listing of that file, for example:

-rw-r--r-- 1 mark.fernandes users 0 Oct 27 11:05 file

Notice the link number is 1 (after the permissions). To check the
inode number of file use:

    ls -il file

2156060563 -rw-r--r-- 1 mark.fernandes users 0 Oct 27 11:05 file

The i-node number is 2156060563 for file. Now to create a hard link use:

    ln file hlink

To check that a hard link was created, use

    ls -il file hlink


2156060563 -rw-r--r-- 2 mark.fernandes users 0 Oct 27 11:05 file
2156060563 -rw-r--r-- 2 mark.fernandes users 0 Oct 27 11:05 hlink

Notice the i-node number (first number in the long list) is the same
and that the link count has gone up by 1. This means any changes to
file automatically get copied to hlink. Try

    echo 'Hello' > file
    
To see the contents use

    cat file

Now try

    cat hlink

Notice the content for both are the same. To delete a hard link use 

    rm hlink

Now run 

    ls -il file

You'll see

2156060563 -rw-r--r-- 1 mark.fernandes users 6 Oct 27 11:05 file

Notice the link counter has gone back down to 1. The number 6 is the
number of characters in file.



* Hard links can only be made to files, not to directories
* Every new link created increases the link counter by 1 and reduces
  disk space by the amount used in the file. So if the file was 1GB in
  size, the next link will reduce the available disk space by 1GB.

Soft links
----------
Soft links are shortcuts to a file or directory. To create a soft link
use:

    ln -s file slink

Now

    ls -l file slink
    
will show

-rw-r--r-- 1 mark.fernandes users 6 Oct 27 11:14 file
lrwxrwxrwx 1 mark.fernandes users 4 Oct 27 11:21 slink -> file


and 

    ls -il file slink


2156060563 -rw-r--r-- 1 mark.fernandes users 6 Oct 27 11:14 file
2156060564 lrwxrwxrwx 1 mark.fernandes users 4 Oct 27 11:21 slink -> file

Notice the inode numbers are different. If you tried

    cat slink 

You will see the contents of file, which would be 'Hello'


* Soft links can be made to files and directories
* Deleting the target does not delete the link (but the link is now
  useless).

So 

    rm file 

will show


lrwxrwxrwx 1 mark.fernandes users 4 Oct 27 11:21 slink -> file

but the link is pointing nowhere, if you try

    cat slink

You will get an error message, like so:

    cat: slink: No such file or directory
