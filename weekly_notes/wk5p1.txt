Using find to locate files
--------------------------

- Problem: You know the partial name of a file (say it has the word
  'people' in it) but you do not know where it is located. How will
  you find it? (answer is below but read on) You can get help by
  using:
    
  man find

- In brief the find command works as follows:

  find (where to search) (what options to use when search)

  where to search: is the location where the file likely is, defaults
  to current working directory, but it can be an absolute or relative
  path

  what options to use while searching:

    -name [filename] searches for files that match filename
    -iname [filename] same as name, but ignore case
    -size [+]n[kMG] 
        when + is used, it means more than n
        n is a number
        k is kilobyte
        M is MB
        G is GB

    -mtime [+-]n 
        when + means after, - means before
        n is number of days

    Answer

        cut -d"," -f7 people.csv| sort | uniq -c | sort 


sort command
------------

The sort command works as follows

    sort [options] filename

- to sort people.csv alphabetically by first field (which in people.csv is
  their last names) use

    sort people.csv

- to sort people.csv alphabetically by the second field (which in people.csv
  is their first names) use

    sort -t, -k2 people.csv
    notes: 
        -t is used specify a delimiter, which in this case is a comma
        -k is used to specify a field (here it is the second field)

- to sort people.csv numerically by their US Zip codes
    
    grep "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]," people.csv|sort -t, -nk6
    notes:
        first get only US Zip codes (5 digit number in the sixth field)
        then sort numerically (-n) on the sixth field (-k6)



Practice Yourself
-----------------


1. How many accounts in /etc/passwd are daemons?
2. Sort and display in /etc/passwd all accounts that:
    
    a. are not daemons 
    b. are daemons

3. How many accounts in /etc/passwd do not permit login, meaning their
   login shell is /bin/false or /sbin/nologin

4. Sort and display answer to practice problem #3

5. Count the number of groups in /etc/group

6. Show all the users on matrix with their user-id followed by
   full username.


[REALLY TOUGH]
7. Sort all records in people.csv based on their 3-digit telephone codes

8. Compare all records in /etc/group with /etc/passwd and print

   a. all accounts that are common to both /etc/passwd and /etc/group
   b. all accounts that only exist in /etc/passwd but not  /etc/group
   c. all accounts that only exist in /etc/group but not  /etc/passwd
