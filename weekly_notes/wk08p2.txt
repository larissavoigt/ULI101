Process and Disk Management
===========================

What is a process? A process is an executing program. Processes in
Linux are identified by their PID (process ID)


Command to list process is

    ps 

Commonly used options with ps

    a show all process by logged in user
    x show all running processes 
    u show all processes include user id


Command to remove a process from memory is 

    kill (pid)

example

    kill 1234


To force a process being killed use -9

    kill -9 (pid)

example

    kill -9 1234

To show all live-update of all running programs use

    top


Other commands used in class

1. Show disk file system usage

    df -h

2. Show disk usuage of your own directory (human readable)

    du -chs ~

3. Same thing as 2 (quota shows disk usage of logged in user) 

    quota -s

4. To put a command into the background use & for example to put eog
   into the background use

    eog &

5. To list all background jobs

    jobs

6. To bring into the foreground use 

    fg (job number, NOTE this is different from PID)

7. To put into background use 

    bg (job number)

8. To suspend a job and put into the background use <CTRL>+Z on the
   job as its running.




Practice Question
=================

Using

    ps axu

Get a list of all unique users that are running programs in memory.
Hint: you will need to use several pipes; start with cut (with the
appropriate options to cut). The output in the end should be similar
to:

ps axu|cut [put your answer here]
500
68
dbus
gdm
root
rtkit
USER

(note, you will get different results than the one above but the last
line should be USER)
