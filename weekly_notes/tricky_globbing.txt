Question: How do you find all files that do not have vowels in /usr/bin?
Answer:
    1. cd /usr/bin
    2. shopt -s extglob; ls +([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz])

Explaination:

    Goto the /usr/bin 
    'shopt -s extglob' turns on extra wildcard matching in bash
    'ls +([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz])' says to list all files that contain ONE OR MORE
    of the following characters: bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz


Question: How do I find out more about the man pages on Linux
Answer:
    
        man -k intro

    gives you the intro page of each section in the man pages. The sections that
    are relevant to most Linux users are in section 1 (user commands) and
    usually section 8 (administrative commands)

    To quickly see all commands in a section use the following

        man -k *|grep \(1\) # which gives you all commands in the section 1

        # redirect above output to a file
        man -k *|grep \(1\) > ./man-1_user_commands 

    Suggested man pages to read are

        man bash
        man find
