Regular expressions
-------------------

[IMPORTANT]
Regular expressions are different from shell wildcards. Very different, so: 
    
    * in shell wildcards mean zero or more characters but
    * in regular expressions mean zero of more of the previous character
    
    ? in shell wildcard means one character
    . in regular expressions mean one character


- Literals : this is text matched within the string without using special
  characters (wildcards)

- Wildcards : these are
    
    . meaning one character
    * meaning zero or more of previous character

- Character class [] 
    - any character with the [] is matched once. So l[oO]se matches
      lose lOse but not loose
    - any character not in the character class [^ ]. So file[^0-4]
      matches filea but not file1,file2,file3,file4. It will match
      file5.


- Anchors
    
    ^ means start of line 
    $ means end of line

- Grouping
    
    (|) means or, example "(Mr|Mrs) Smith"
