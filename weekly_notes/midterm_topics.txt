            mv [from] [to]

     - create directories: mkdir: -p 
     
     - remove files: rm: -r -f
     
     - remove directories: rmdir, rm -rf

     - list permissions: ls -l (ls -ld)

     - change permissions: chmod 
            chmod (octal number for user/group/others)
            chmod (+-= rwx ugo)

     - change ownership: chown

     - search for files: find
            find (location to search) (find options)

     - info database: info (CTRL+Q,CTRL+C)
     - html/pdf documents: typically with /usr/share/doc

Absolute and relative pathnames
-------------------------------

    * absolute pathnames ALWAYS begin with /
    * relative pathnames NEVER begin with / and pathname is relative to the
        1current working directory

        .  present directory
        .. parent directory
        ~  home directory 
        [anything else other than /] directory/file name
    

Wildcards and shell expansion
-----------------------------

    * Using wildcards to get files: *,?,[],!
    * Extending globbing with bash see file:
            
            /home/mark.fernandes/uli101/weekly_notes/tricky_globbing.txt

    * Difference between single and double quotes

Data Representation
--------------------

    * HOWTO convert between decimal and bin/oct/hex
        (hint: use math to convert)

    * HOWTO convert between bin/oct/hex and oct/hex/bin, hex/oct/bin, etc.
        (hint: draw the table for numbers: 0-15)



Live CD
-------

    * using ssh/scp/sftp to connect and transfer files remotely
    * get/put files local (when running LIVE CD)  and remote (matrix)
