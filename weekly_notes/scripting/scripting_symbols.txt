Some bash scripting symbols
----------------------------


$0 - the full path (with the script name) to the script 
$1 - first parameter sent to script
$2 - second parameter 

$?   
    exit status of previous command, generally values greater than zero are
    errors whereas 0 is no error. Higher number is more severe error.

$#
    number of arguments passed to the script

$*
    all arguments does not respect quoting

$@
    all arguments respects quoting

Number comparisons
-------------------
 -lt is numeric less than
 -gt is numeric greater than
 -le is numeric less than or equal to
 -ge is numeric greater than or equal to
 -ne is not equal
 -eq is equal

You CANNOT use greater than symbol '>'  or less than symbol '<' to do number
comparisons because the shell uses 

    > to do output redirection, eg: cat abc > /tmp/abc 
    < to do input redirection, eg: cat < /tmp/abc


String comparison
------------------
 = for equal
 != for not equal
strings do not have less than or greater than methods
