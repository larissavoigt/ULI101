Using a loop in a script
------------------------

Task 1 is:
    - show all environment variables.

The way to see environment variables from the command line is to run the following
command:

$ set|less

The output of that command is the environment variables. 

Task 2 is:
    - show all the BASH environment variables

Strategy for writing a script that does the same thing as the command above:

- Get the environment variables (using set) into some sort of collection.
- Go through the collection one item at a time.
- Display the item if a part of the environment variable matches "BASH".

The script that does this is:


---- SCRIPT START BELOW THIS LINE ---
#!/bin/bash

# get all environment variables into ALL_ENV_VARIABLES
ALL_ENV_VARIABLES=$(set)

echo "show all variables that have BASH"

# go through each item in the collection
for EACH_ITEM in $ALL_ENV_VARIABLES
do
    # does the item have the word BASH
    if [[ $(echo $EACH_ITEM|grep BASH) ]]
    then 
        # yes then show the item
        echo $EACH_ITEM
    fi
done
---- SCRIPT END ABOVE THIS LINE ---


Exercise:
----------
- From the command line, create a temporary directory in your path, call it
  script-temp.

- go into the directory script-temp and make five files like so:
    touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file5

- now write a script that will add the ".txt" extension to the files. This means
  after the script runs, listings should show the following:

    $ls
    file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
